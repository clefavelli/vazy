								UNLIMITED PROGRAM.

After a pre-pay period ends, your subscription membership will automatically renew and you will be billed every month at the then current fee to your payment method on file. The current monthly Unlimited subscription fee is $159.00 (plus applicable taxes), but is subject to change at our discretion and any such change will be effective for any subsequent renewal Subscription Period.

The Extra Spots Fee(s) shall be calculated as follows: $39.00, multiplied by the ratio of the remaining days in the Subscription Period divided by the Subscription Period, multiplied by the total number of Extra Spots (rounded up to the nearest cent).

If you remove an Extra Spot and fail to return the corresponding Unlimited Program Product by the Extra Spot Return Date and before the end of the subsequent Subscription Period, then as of that date you will again be charged the monthly Extra Spots Fee(s) until you remove the Extra Spot and return the corresponding Unlimited Program Product.

If you subscribe to VAZY APP Update, during the first Billing Period (which is defined in the “SUBSCRIPTION FEES” paragraph below), you will be entitled to rent up to four Products for that Billing Period from a curated edit of Products designated on the Site (the “VAZY APP Update Products”). Products not included in VAZY APP Update are determined by us in our sole discretion. Products not eligible for VAZY APP Update include, without limitation: high-priced formal wear, VAZY APP’s higher-end designers, and other items on our site that may be limited by availability or geographic concerns. Subject to your compliance with these Terms (including payment of fees) and our right to terminate VAZY APP Update, you may keep the four VAZY APP Update Products for as many Billing Periods as you wish as long as your account is in good standing. At the beginning of each subsequent Billing Period, you will be entitled to one free shipment (which means one outgoing shipment and one return shipment) (a “Shipment”), where you can exchange any number of VAZY APP Update Products you have at home for new VAZY APP Update Products you select via our Site or App (but not more than the total number of VAZY APP Update Products you have at home). You may use your Shipment at any time during the then-current Billing Period.

You are expected to promptly return the VAZY APP Update Products you are exchanging under your Shipment as explained in the “RETURNS; LATE FEES” paragraph below. Using your Shipment is your only chance to exchange VAZY APP Update Products during any Billing Period at no additional cost to you. If any VAZY APP Update Products that you receive via your Shipment (or VAZY APP Update Products that you receive in your first Billing Period) don’t fit you, you may use one flat-fee swap (a “Fit Replacement”) within 48 hours of receiving that Shipment to exchange those VAZY APP Update Products for new VAZY APP Update Products. If you do not initiate a Fit Replacement on our Site, App or by calling Customer Service at 1-800-509-0842, within 48 hours after receiving your Shipment, then you will lose your Fit Replacement for that Billing Period. After initiating a Fit Replacement indicating the VAZY APP Update Products you would like to exchange, you will have 48 hours to select replacement VAZY APP Update Products. If you do not select replacement VAZY APP Update Products within 48 hours after initiating a Fit Replacement, you will lose that Fit Replacement. Once you complete a Fit Replacement by selecting replacement VAZY APP Update Products, you will be charged a flat-rate fee of $12.95, and you are expected to return the VAZY APP Update Products from your Shipment that you are exchanging as explained in the “RETURNS; LATE FEES” paragraph below.
